# Instagram Image Downloader
Because sometimes social media really sucks but that picture/vid is really nice. Saves file to directory that you are running the script on. Only works for accounts that are unprivated.

```
Setup:

pip3 install urllib
pip3 install bs4

Run:

python3 insta_magic.py <type(image/video)> <link> <filename.jpg/filename.mp4>
```
